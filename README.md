# 🌐 Global Insights from Gapminder (R)

This project explores global trends in health and wealth using the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) dataset. The analysis focuses on visualizing uncertainty, inequality, and development across continents using various advanced ggplot-based techniques in R.

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Histograms** of GDP per capita (log scale) across continents in 1997
- **Ridge plots** showing the evolution of life expectancy from 1952 to 2007
- **Violin + Box + Strip plots** comparing GDP per capita across continents (excluding Oceania) in 2007

---

## 📦 Packages Used

- `tidyverse` – Core data wrangling and visualization
- `gapminder` – The dataset
- `ggridges` – For density ridge plots
- `gghalves` – For half violin and boxplots

---

## 🧠 Insights

- GDP per capita distributions are highly skewed, requiring log transformations for accurate interpretation.
- Life expectancy has steadily increased globally, but disparities remain across regions.
- Advanced visualization techniques help illustrate uncertainty and inequality clearly.
